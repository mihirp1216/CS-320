# 1) How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I assure that my code is functional and secure by writing code that satisfies the requirements and has been tested to verify that it does so. 

# 2) How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I evaluate user demands through user interviews and testing, as well as through involving users in the development process. 

# 3) How do I approach designing software? 
In my opinion, the most helpful strategy is to tailor the development to match an existing demand. The product's users should be involved in the design process. With each iteration, the designs improve until a software product that people appreciate is available.
